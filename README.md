# BBC Broadcast Billings Data

http://billings.acropolis.org.uk/

This repository has been created to allow issues around the publication of
billings data as part of the Research & Education Space to be [tracked](https://github.com/bbcarchdev/billings/issues) and to allow data dumps to be
[downloaded](https://github.com/bbcarchdev/billings/releases).

## Structure

Each file (in the `n-triples` subdirectory) contains information about a
single broadcast. Its URI has the form:

    http://billings.acropolis.org.uk/UUID#id

(where `UUID` is the 32-character hexadecimal identifier used in the filename)

This broadcast event is related to information about the *version* and
*episode* that the broadcast is of, whose URIs are in the form:

    http://billings.acropolis.org.uk/UUID#version
    
    http://billings.acropolis.org.uk/UUID#episode

These are modelled using the [Programmes Ontology](http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/po). Where we know that the broadcasts, versions and episodes described in
the data have other identifiers (including those in other public BBC systems),
we've expressed that using `owl:sameAs`.

The data also contains information about the abstract document describing
the broadcast, and about the concrete N-Triples serialisation of that
document:

    http://billings.acropolis.org.uk/UUID
    
    http://billings.acropolis.org.uk/UUID.nt
